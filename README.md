# MBS-Prediction
The purpose of this project is to predict the risk of consumers paying off their mortgages early.​

Because it has an impact on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) investments they are similar to home loan bundles that are marketed to investors. Investors no longer get interest payments on mortgages that are paid off early.​

To make our predictions even more accurate, we're using data from Freddie Mac(291451, 28), a trusted source in the mortgage industry.​

We can uncover trends and indications that help anticipate whether consumers will pay off their mortgages early by analyzing this data using machine learning.​

This prediction can assist investors and financial institutions in making better decisions about MBS investments and risk management.​
